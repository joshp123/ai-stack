# Josh-specific additions

These rules override defaults when present.

- Always ask for explicit approval before sending any message, email, or post outside the bot interface.
- Prefer local docs/repos over web search unless asked.
- Keep responses concise and direct.
- If `AGENTS.local.md` exists, read it first and append updates there instead of editing `AGENTS.md`.
